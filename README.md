## Introduction
Have you ever wanted your resident large, expensive humanoid robot to help you solve a children's puzzle? We aim to show how a Baxter robot can be programmed to solve a jigsaw puzzle with computer vision techniques and minimal human interaction. More concretely, we give the robot an image of the completed puzzle, along with the puzzle's dimensions and number of pieces, then place pieces on the table one by one and have Baxter place them with correct position and orientation.

## Design

### Hardware
We worked with:
- 1 arm of the [Baxter robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baxter_(robot)) with [suction gripper kit](https://www.generationrobots.com/en/401622-vacuum-gripper-starter-kit-for-baxter.html)
- large floor puzzle: 24 pieces
- Logitech C920 webcam + tripod
- [AR tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARTag)

### Calibration

We break up our approach to puzzle solving into two main stages: calibration and a piece solver loop. 
The calibration stage 

## Implementation

## Challenges

mention calibration issues, precision issues, segmentation issues

### Results

### Conclusions


This website showcases the work of Rebecca Abraham, Jason Huynh, and Evan Lohn on a primarily self-directed EECS C106A class project.
